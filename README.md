# Tetris

## About
This is my first C# project. I just wanted something fairly simple to get my feet wet.
There are still plenty of things I would like to add to it including:
- Music and sound effects
- Improved controls including soft drops
- Scoring
- Improved randomization
- etc

## Navigating Menus
Up and Down arrows to change selection.
Enter to select.

## How to Play
Left and Right arrows move the active piece side to side.
Spacebar initiates a hard drop. (no soft drops currently)
F and D keys rotate the piece clockwise and counterclockwise, respectively.
ESC pauses the game.
